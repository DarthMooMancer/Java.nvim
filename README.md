Nvim-Java
---------

Why?
------

The main goal is the plugin is to be simple and extensible for Java developers. Are there better plugins? Most likely, however this has simple functions for:

- Creating New Projects
- Creating New Files (With Class Generation)
- Building Files (Currently only Main.java files)
- Running Files (Again only Main.java files)

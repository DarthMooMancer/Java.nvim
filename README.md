## Questions and Contributing

If you want to contribute, make a PR or issue and I will answer as soon as I see it. 

!!! I suck at lua, and would like some help if you are able to contribute. If all else fails I will use Ai to help me add features and/or fix features. Help me from using it and make my learning of lua and life easier. !!!

If you have questions, just ask in issues or discussions and I will answer them.
